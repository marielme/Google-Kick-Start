Lucky for us.\n\nThe alien would like to bring home its favorite human songs, but it only has a very strange instrument to do it with: a piano with just 4 keys of different pitches.\n\nThe alien converts a song by writing it down as a series of keys on the alien piano. Obviously, this piano will not be able to convert our songs completely, as our songs tend to have many more than 4 pitches.\n\nThe alien will settle for converting our songs with the following rules instead:\n\n* The first note in our song can be converted to any key on the alien piano.\n* For every note after,\n    * if its pitch is higher than the previous note, it should be converted into a higher-pitched key than the previous note's conversion;\n    * if lower, it should be converted into a lower-pitched key than the previous note's conversion;\n    * if exactly identical, it should be converted into the same key as the previous note's conversion.\n\nNote: two notes with the same pitch do not need to be converted into the same key if they are not adjacent.\n\nWhat the alien wants to know is: how often will it have to break its rules when converting a particular song?\n\nTo elaborate, let us describe one of our songs as having **K** notes. The first note we describe as \"note 1\", the second note \"note 2\", and the last note \"note **K**.\" \n\nSo note 2 comes immediately after note 1. \n\nNow if note 2 is lower than note 1 in our version of the song, yet converted to an equally-pitched or lower-pitched key (relative to note 2's conversion) in the alien's version of the song, then we consider that a single rule break. \n\nFor each test case, return the minimum amount of times the alien must necessarily break one of its rules in converting that song."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Input"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow. \n\nEach test case consists of two lines. \n\nThe first line consists of a single integer, **K**. \n\nThe second line consists of **K** space-separated integers, **A1**, **A2** ... **AK**, where **Ai** refers to the pitch of the i-th note for this test case."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Output"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the minimum number of times that particular test case will require the alien to break its own rules during the conversion process."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Limits"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Memory limit: 1GB.\n\n1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100. \n\n1 ≤ **Ai** ≤ 106. \n\nTest set 1\n\nTime limit: 20 seconds.\n\n1 ≤ **K** ≤ 10. \n\nTest set 2\n\nTime limit: 40 seconds.\n\n1 ≤ **K** ≤ 104. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sample"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Input  <br>\n2 <br>\n5 <br>\n1 5 100 500 1 <br>\n8 <br>\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n\nOutput <br>\nCase #1: 0<br>\nCase #2: 1\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will use the notation A, B, C, D for the alien piano keys where A is the lowest note, and D is the highest. In sample case #1, the alien can simply map our song into the following sequence: A B C D C and this correctly reflects all the following: \n* our first note with pitch 1 maps to A,<br>\n* our second note with pitch 5 maps to its key B. 5 > 1, and B is a higher key than A,<br>\n* our third note with pitch 100 maps to its key C. 100 > 5, and C is a higher key than B,<br>\n* our fourth note with pitch 500 maps to its key D. 500 > 100, and D is a higher key than C,<br>\n* our fifth note with pitch 1 maps to its key C. 1 < 500, and C is a lower key than D.<br>\n\nSo none of the rules are broken. Note: A B C D C is not the only way of conversion. A B C D A or A B C D B are also eligible conversions.<br>\nIn sample case #2, the only conversion sequence that provides the minimal result of 1 rule broken is: A B C D A B C D. Notably, the rule break comes from the fact that our 4th note with pitch 4 is lower than our 5th note with pitch 5, but A is a lower key than D."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"julia-1.4","display_name":"Julia 1.4.1","language":"julia"},"language_info":{"file_extension":".jl","name":"julia","mimetype":"application/julia","version":"1.4.1"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
